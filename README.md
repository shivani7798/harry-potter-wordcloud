# Harry Potter WordCloud

Generates word clouds from Harry Potter and the Sorcererâ€™s Stone using fun masks like Hogwarts and Harryâ€™s glasses.

This project is hands-on and fun!! The word clouds visualize the most frequent words in the book, with words sized according to their frequency. By using shaped masks, the clouds take on the form of Harry Potter symbols for a more magical look.
